This is my longest extended time away from using my blog, typing my thoughts, moving the entire project into a workable state again.

While this project is basically putting two products together, Tina and Astro, the two main processes of (1) making it work and (2) improving the experience, has been fun and also challenging for me.

The pay off of seeing it finally working is fantastic.
