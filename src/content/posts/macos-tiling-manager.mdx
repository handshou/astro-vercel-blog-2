Using yabai has been a big game changer, because I can have specific panes for the apps that I use. With one hotkey, I can summon specific apps.

The biggest win of all is opening apps without having focus moving to the opening app. Yabai puts that new app straight to the assigned window without pulling focus. 

How neat :)
