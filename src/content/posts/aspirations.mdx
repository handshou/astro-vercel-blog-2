  A person I've met online asked last week, what are your aspirations? Here are
  my shower thoughts.

Are aspirations related to our day jobs? Projects with most time spent? Passions?

Are they things I value highly at my core? 

"Core" means the trunk of values in work I put an extremely high weight to.

For now, I've thought of a few things:

1. Automation. This one is recurring in the work I do.

2\. Growth. I value getting insights in how I have changed my work process.

3\. Good reason. Why do I like doing these things? What am I contributing towards in the long term? Is it for good reason? Are they selfish?

I'll revisit this idea, and I have to respond to the asker soon!
