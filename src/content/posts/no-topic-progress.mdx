Hey y'all

Its been couple of months since this project started, we made a few changes since the start and I love where we have gotten to!

This time of the year has me feeling quite lonely, but it has also been a dip in pushing myself to grow. So I figured if I had that down, then all should end up better in a couple of weeks.

Anyway, here's small daily progress I want to build before the end of the year:

1. 3 x 15 push ups
2. 3 x 10 pull ups
3. 3 x 20 bench dips
4. 3 x 10 jump negative dips
5. 3 x 10 full body dips
6. 3 x 20 squats
7. 3 x 20 pistol squats
8. 45 second bolt-hold
9. 20 second L-sit hold
10. 20 second hand stand
11. 3 x 12 pike push ups
12. 1 min bar hang

Lets make some progress.
